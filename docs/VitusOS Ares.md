# VitusOS Ares — Full Roadmap (Phase 1 → Final Vision)

**Document Version:** 2.0

**Last Updated:** January 6, 2026

**Scope:** Full end-to-end roadmap for openSEF + VitusOS Ares, from Phase 1 foundation to final macOS‑level polish in the Ares design language.

---

## Executive Summary

VitusOS Ares is a complete Linux desktop environment built around **openSEF**, a Cocoa‑inspired application framework and UI toolkit. The goal is to deliver a **cohesive, polished desktop** that feels purpose‑built—not a collection of glued‑together components. This roadmap lays out the **entire project path** from today’s Phase 1 foundation to a finished system with Ares‑level UI/UX polish.

**Core goals:**
- A stable, C/C++ hybrid architecture (wlroots compositor in C, framework/shell in C++).
- A mature application framework (Foundation + AppKit analogs).
- A consistent Ares design system across system apps and third‑party apps.
- End‑to‑end system experience: boot → lock → desktop → shutdown with no terminal exposure.

---

## Big Picture Overview (All Phases)

**Phase 1: Framework Foundation**
- Foundation primitives (application lifecycle, run loop, notifications, bundles).
- Basic window/view scaffolding.
- Minimal app can run and render a view hierarchy.

**Phase 2: Windowing + Surface Integration**
- Real window surfaces with Wayland backend connection.
- Stable window lifecycle, focus, and event routing.

**Phase 3: Layout, Input, and Responder Chain**
- View tree layout system.
- Input routing, focus, responder chain.

**Phase 4: Theming + Appearance System**
- Ares design tokens (color, typography, spacing).
- Dynamic appearance hooks and component styling consistency.

**Phase 5: Controls + Text System**
- Full widget suite (buttons, sliders, lists, text fields).
- Text shaping, editing, and accessibility‑ready semantics.

**Phase 6: System Services + Integration**
- Notifications, clipboard, drag/drop, settings, launch services.
- App bundle conventions and metadata.

**Phase 7: Shell + System Apps**
- Panel, dock, settings, file manager, launcher.
- First‑party apps showing framework maturity.

**Phase 8: Performance + Stability**
- Profiling, GPU optimizations, lower latency input.
- Robust window management and crash recovery.

**Phase 9: Ares Polished Release**
- Final UI/UX polish at macOS‑level quality.
- Cohesive system branding, animation tuning, and accessibility.

# Phase 1 — Framework Foundation ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ **Completed January 2026**

**Objective:** Establish the minimal Foundation and AppKit surface that makes openSEF a real application framework.

**Deliverables:**
- OSFApplication lifecycle (`run`, `stop`, launch/terminate callbacks).
- OSFRunLoop task scheduling.
- OSFNotificationCenter pub/sub.
- OSFBundle metadata loader.
- OSFWindow + OSFView hierarchy (minimal).
- Minimal sample app proves lifecycle + view rendering.

**Definition of Done:**
- A minimal openSEF app can launch via OSFApplication, create a window, and render a view hierarchy. ✅

---

# Phase 2 — Windowing + Surface Integration ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ **Completed January 2026**

**Objective:** Replace offscreen rendering with real Wayland windows. Ensure window lifecycle and surface connection are stable.

**Key Tasks:**
- Implement OSFWindow → Wayland surface creation.
- Bind OSFWindow to OSFBackend/OSFWaylandSurface.
- Handle window close, focus, visibility.
- Ensure the app can create multiple windows.

**Definition of Done:**
- A sample app opens a real Wayland window and renders a basic view tree to it. ✅

---

# Phase 3 — Layout + Input + Responder Chain ✅ Complete

**Status:** ✅ **Completed January 2026**

**Objective:** Make view trees interactive and layout‑aware.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Introduced `sizeThatFits()` and `intrinsicContentSize()` for intrinsic sizing
- ✅ Implemented `OSFStackView` (stack/grid layout) with spacing, alignment, distribution
- ✅ Added `OSFResponder` base and event routing (mouse/keyboard)
- ✅ Input focus and first‑responder management via `OSFWindow`
- ✅ Mouse capture (pressedView) and hover tracking (hoveredView)
- ✅ Basic hit‑testing throughout view hierarchy

**Definition of Done:**
- A window supports buttons and text fields with keyboard/mouse interaction. ✅

---

# Phase 4 — Theming + Appearance System

**Objective:** Make Ares design consistent, configurable, and shared across all UI components.

**Key Tasks:**
- Create OSFAppearance + OSFThemeManager.
- Centralize Ares tokens (color, typography, spacing, radii).
- Theming hooks for widgets (hover/pressed/disabled states).

**Definition of Done:**
- Components derive visuals from the theme system; switching themes updates UI.

---

# Phase 5 — Controls + Text System

**Objective:** Expand AppKit‑level widget coverage and mature text rendering/editing.

**Key Tasks:**
- Expand widget set: sliders, toggles, lists, progress, menus.
- Text system: attributed strings, editable text fields, selection.
- Accessibility‑ready view metadata.

**Definition of Done:**
- Standard UI screens can be built without custom rendering.

---

# Phase 6 — System Services + App Integration

**Objective:** Provide system‑level APIs expected by modern apps.

**Key Tasks:**
- Clipboard, drag‑and‑drop, notifications.
- App bundle spec (metadata, icons, resources).
- Launch services and file association system.
- Settings APIs (appearance, input, audio, power).

**Definition of Done:**
- A third‑party app can ship as a bundle and integrate with system services.

---

# Phase 7 — Shell + First‑Party Apps ⚠️ Partial

**Status:** ⚠️ **Partially Complete (Built Early)**

**Objective:** Build the official system shell and apps on top of openSEF to validate framework maturity.

**Completed:**
- ✅ Panel (global menu bar, clock, system tray stubs)
- ✅ Dock (icon display, click handlers)
- ✅ Wallpaper rendering
- ✅ Layer-shell integration with compositor

**Remaining:**
- 📋 File manager (osf-filer - skeleton exists)
- 📋 Settings app (osf-settings - skeleton exists)
- 📋 Terminal (osf-terminal - skeleton exists)
- 📋 Text editor
- 📋 System launcher and app switcher

**Definition of Done:**
- A cohesive daily‑driver desktop experience exists for early adopters.

> **Development Note:** We built shell components early (before Phases 3-6) to validate the desktop experience. Full shell functionality requires completing foundation phases for proper layout, theming, and system services.

---

# Phase 8 — Performance + Stability

**Objective:** Make it robust, smooth, and fast across devices.

**Key Tasks:**
- Optimize render loops and animation scheduling.
- Profiling and memory leak fixes.
- Window management stability (multi‑monitor, resizing, focus).

**Definition of Done:**
- Desktop is stable under normal use and performs consistently.

---

# Phase 9 — Final Ares Polish (End Goal)

**Objective:** Deliver the final Ares UX: warm, polished, and cohesive at macOS‑level quality—while remaining distinctly VitusOS.

**Key Tasks:**
- Full animation and motion curve tuning.
- Micro‑interaction polish (hover, press, focus, window transitions).
- Accessibility, internationalization, and localization support.
- Design review pass for all system apps.

**Definition of Done:**
- Users can boot into VitusOS Ares and experience a fully cohesive, native‑feeling desktop.

---

## Final Deliverable Vision

At completion, VitusOS Ares provides:
- A full Cocoa‑like openSEF framework for native apps.
- A stable, visually polished Wayland desktop.
- Ares design language applied consistently across system UI and apps.
- A platform that feels intentional and product‑grade, not “just another Linux theme.”

---

## Notes for Implementation AIs and Developers

- **Stick to the phase sequence.** Framework stability must lead the roadmap.
- **Avoid breaking earlier phases.** Each phase is additive and testable.
- **Always align with Ares design tokens** so UI is consistent.
